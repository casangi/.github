**CASA**, the Common Astronomy Software Applications, serves as the primary data processing software for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), and is often used also for other radio telescopes. 

The CASA organization on GitHub contains prototype packages that the CASA team is developing for the next generation of radio telescopes, along with other ancillary packages related to production CASA (such as documentation). The production CASA code is hosted on [Bitbucket](https://open-bitbucket.nrao.edu/projects/CASA/repos/casa6/browse).
